# GRAVITY PRODUCT DEFINITION: What is a "Strategy"? 🧠

## 1. The Misconception
Many users confuse **"Signals"** (Telegram Channels) with **"Strategies"** (ITC Logic).
*   **Signal (Raw Material):** "Buy Gold Now @ 2000". This is just information. It can be good or bad.
*   **Strategy (The Factory):** *HOW* to process that signal to make money safely.

## 2. The "Strategy Preset" (.json)
In the Gravity Marketplace, a **Strategy** is a **Configuration File** that completely automates the ITC software. When a user buys a Strategy, they are buying the **Setups & Rules** of a Pro Trader.

### What is inside a Strategy Preset?
A Strategy Preset contains 4 Key Pillars:

#### A. Signal Sources (The Input)
*   *Which channels to listen to?*
*   Example: "Listen to 'Gold VIP' and 'Sniper X', but ignore 'Free Channel'."

#### B. Intelligent Filters (The Gatekeeper)
*   *Which signals to accept/reject?*
*   **Regex Rules:** "Reject if message contains 'Martingale' or 'High Risk'."
*   **Time Filter:** "Only trade London Session (14:00 - 17:00)."
*   **News Filter:** "Stop trading 30 mins before High Impact News."

#### C. Risk Management (The Shield) 🛡️
*   *How much money to risk?*
*   **Dynamic Lots:** "Risk exactly 1% of Balance per trade."
*   **Equity Guard:** "Stop trading if daily loss hits -3%."
*   **Max Floating:** "Close all if floating drawdown > 10%."

#### D. Trade Management (The Exit) 🚀
*   *How to secure profit?*
*   **Trailing Stop:** "Move SL to Entry after +20 pips. Trail by 10 pips."
*   **Partial Close:** "Close 50% lot at TP1, let the rest run."
*   **Break Even:** "Move SL to BE+1 after TP1 hit."

## 3. Why Buy a Strategy? (Value Proposition)
A raw signal channel might have 80% accuracy, but a user can still lose money if they hold too long or over-leverage.

**Buying a "Strategy" means buying a Proven System:**
> "I am buying Rick's 'Gold Hunter' Strategy. It setup ITC to listen to his private channel, filters out risky news trade, automatically risks 2% per trade, and locks profit at 30 pips. All I do is click 'ON'."
