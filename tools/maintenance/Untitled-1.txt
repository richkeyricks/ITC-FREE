```

### Signal Format Support
The parser handles multiple signal formats:

```
# Format 1: Standard BUY XAUUSD Entry: 2650.00 TP: 2670.00 SL: 2640.00 # Format 2: Compact SELL EURUSD @ 1.0850 TP 1.0800 SL 1.0900 # Format 3: Natural Language (AI Required) "Looking to short gold around 2650, target 2620, stop above 2680"
```


```
# Format 1: Standard BUY XAUUSD Entry: 2650.00 TP: 2670.00 SL: 2640.00 # Format 2: Compact SELL EURUSD @ 1.0850 TP 1.0800 SL 1.0900 # Format 3: Natural Language (AI Required) "Looking to short gold around 2650, target 2620, stop above 2680"
```

### Code Example: Custom Signal Handler
```
from modules.parser.signal_parser import parse_signal from modules.mt5.executor import open_trade # Parse incoming signal signal = parse_signal(raw_message) if signal: result = open_trade( symbol=signal['symbol'], order_type=signal['type'], entry=signal['entry'], tp=signal['tp'], sl=signal['sl'], lot=calculate_lot(risk_percent=1.0) ) print(f"Trade executed: {result}")
```

### Database Schema
```
-- User Profiles (RLS Enabled) CREATE TABLE user_profiles ( id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), hwid TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, name TEXT, email TEXT, balance DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0, equity DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0, total_pl DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0, is_pro BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() ); -- Trade History CREATE TABLE trades ( id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), user_id TEXT NOT NULL, symbol TEXT NOT NULL, type TEXT NOT NULL, lot DECIMAL(10,2), entry DECIMAL(15,5), sl DECIMAL(15,5), tp DECIMAL(15,5), result TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() ); -- AI Chat Memory CREATE TABLE messages ( id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), user_id TEXT NOT NULL, role TEXT NOT NULL, content TEXT NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() );
```

### Row Level Security
```
-- Users can only see their own data CREATE POLICY "Users can only access own data" ON user_profiles FOR ALL USING (hwid = current_setting('request.jwt.claims')::json->>'sub');
```
