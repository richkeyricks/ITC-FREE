# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. Is it safe to use?
Yes. **ITC +AI Enterprise** is built with modern security standards. It uses local encryption for your MT5 passwords and secure Row Level Security (RLS) for cloud synchronization. We do not store your passwords on our servers.

## 2. Do I need to be a programmer?
No. The Public Release is a standalone `.exe`. You only need to edit a simple configuration file (`.env`) to get started. No Python knowledge is required.

## 3. Does it work with any broker?
The software works with any broker that supports **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)** and has the Terminal API enabled.

## 4. Why is AI recommended?
Standard copiers use rigid "Regex" rules which break if a signal provider changes their format slightly (e.g., adding an emoji or typing "Entry" instead of "at"). Our **Neural Heuristic Cluster** understands natural language, making the system much more resilient.

## 5. How do I get support?
