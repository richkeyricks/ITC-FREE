## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the **ITC +AI Enterprise** ecosystem seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do NOT use the public issue tracker. 

Instead, please report it through one of the following channels:

1.  **Direct Contact:** Message the developer via GitHub.
2.  **Private Disclosure:** Email the developer (if provided in GitHub profile) with the subject `SECURITY VULNERABILITY: [Brief Description]`.

### What to include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept).
- Potential impact analysis.

We aim to respond to all legitimate security reports within **48 hours** and provide a resolution according to the severity of the issue.
